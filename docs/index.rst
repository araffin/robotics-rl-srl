S-RL Toolbox: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and State Representation Learning (SRL) Toolbox for Robotics

Github repository: https://github.com/araffin/robotics-rl-srl

Video: https://youtu.be/qNsHMkIsqJc

This repository was made to evaluate State Representation Learning
methods using Reinforcement Learning. It integrates (automatic logging,
plotting, saving, loading of trained agent) various RL algorithms
(PPO, A2C, ARS, ACKTR, DDPG, DQN, ACER, CMA-ES, SAC, TRPO) along with different SRL methods
(see `SRL Repo <https://github.com/araffin/srl-zoo>`__) in an efficient
way (1 Million steps in 1 Hour with 8-core cpu and 1 Titan X GPU).

We also release customizable Gym environments for working with
simulation (Kuka arm, Mobile Robot in PyBullet, running at 250 FPS on a
8-core machine) and real robots (Baxter Robot, Robobo with ROS).

Main Features
-------------

-  10 RL algorithms (`Stable Baselines`_ included)
-  logging / plotting / visdom integration / replay trained agent
-  hyperparameter search (hyperband, hyperopt)
-  integration with State Representation Learning (SRL) methods (for
   feature extraction)
-  visualisation tools (explore latent space, display action proba, live
   plot in the state space, â€¦)
-  robotics environments to compare SRL methods
-  easy install using anaconda env or Docker images (CPU/GPU)

.. note::
  This documentation only gives an overview of the RL Toolbox,
  and provides some examples. However, for a complete list of possible argument,
  you have to use the ``--help`` argument. For example, you can try:
  ``python -m rl_baselines.train --help``
