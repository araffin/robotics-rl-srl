# S-RL Toolbox: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and State Representation Learning (SRL) Toolbox for Robotics

This repository was made to evaluate State Representation Learning methods using Reinforcement Learning. It integrates (automatic logging, plotting, saving, loading of trained agent) various RL algorithms (PPO, A2C, ARS, ACKTR, DDPG, DQN, ACER, CMA-ES, SAC, TRPO) along with different SRL methods (see [SRL Repo](https://github.com/araffin/srl-zoo)) in an efficient way (1 Million steps in 1 Hour with 8-core cpu and 1 Titan X GPU).

We also release customizable Gym environments for working with simulation (Kuka arm, Mobile Robot in PyBullet, running at 250 FPS on a 8-core machine) and real robots (Baxter Robot, Robobo with ROS).

- visualisation tools (explore latent space, display action proba, live plot in the state space, ...)
- robotics environments to compare SRL methods
- easy install using anaconda env or Docker images (CPU/GPU)

## Documentation

Documentation is available online: [https://s-rl-toolbox.readthedocs.io/](https://s-rl-toolbox.readthedocs.io/)

## Example

Here is a quick example of how to train a PPO2 agent on `MobileRobotGymEnv-v0` environment for 10 000 steps using 4 parallel processes:

```
python -m rl_baselines.train --algo ppo2 --no-vis --num-cpu 4 --num-timesteps 10000 --env MobileRobotGymEnv-v0
```


The complete command (logs will be saved in `logs/` folder):

```
python -m rl_baselines.train --algo rl_algo --env env1 --log-dir logs/ --srl-model raw_pixels --num-timesteps 10000 --no-vis
```

To use the robot's position as input instead of pixels, just pass `--srl-model ground_truth` instead of `--srl-model raw_pixels`


## Installation

**Python 3 is required** (python 2 is not supported because of OpenAI baselines)

Note: we are using [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines), a fork of OpenAI Baselines with unified interface and other improvements (e.g. tensorboard support).


### Using Anaconda

0. Download the project (note the `--recursive` argument because we are using git submodules):
```
git clone git@github.com:araffin/robotics-rl-srl.git --recursive
```

1. Install the swig library:
```
sudo apt-get install swig
```

2. Install the dependencies using `environment.yml` file (for anaconda users) in the current environment
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
source activate py35
```

### Using Docker

Please read the [documentation](https://s-rl-toolbox.readthedocs.io/) for more details.


## Reinforcement Learning

Several algorithms from [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) have been integrated along with some evolution strategies and SAC:

- A2C: A synchronous, deterministic variant of Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C).
- ACER: Sample Efficient Actor-Critic with Experience Replay
- ACKTR: Actor Critic using Kronecker-Factored Trust Region
- ARS: Augmented Random Search (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07055)
- CMA-ES: Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
- DDPG: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients
- DeepQ: DQN and variants (Double, Dueling, prioritized experience replay)
- PPO1: Proximal Policy Optimization (MPI Implementation)
- PPO2: Proximal Policy Optimization (GPU Implementation)
- SAC: Soft Actor Critic
- TRPO: Trust Region Policy Optimization (MPI Implementation)

Please read the [documentation](https://s-rl-toolbox.readthedocs.io/) for more details on how to train/load an agent on discrete/continuous actions, and how to add your own rl algorithm.


### Hyperparameter Search

This repository also allows hyperparameter search, using [hyperband](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560) or [hyperopt](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4443-algorithms-for-hyper-parameter-optimization.pdf) for the implemented RL algorithms

for example, here is the command for a hyperband search on PPO2, ground truth on the mobile robot environment:
```bash
python -m rl_baselines.hyperparam_search --optimizer hyperband --algo ppo2 --env MobileRobotGymEnv-v0 --srl-model ground_truth
```

## Environments

All the environments we propose follow the OpenAI Gym interface. We also extended this interface (adding extra methods) to work with SRL methods (see [State Representation Learning Models](#state-representation-learning-models)).

<sub><sup>1. The action space can use 6 axis arm joints control with the `--joints` flag</sup></sub><br>
<sup><sup>2. The reward can be the euclidian distance to the target with the `--shape-reward` flag</sup></sup><br>
<sup><sup>3. When using `--shape-reward` and ```--continuous```, the reward for hitting the button is 50 and for being out of bounds is -250. This is to prevent the agent hitting the table to stop the environment early and obtaining a higher reward</sup></sup><br>
<sup><sup>4. The ground truth can be relative position from agent to the target by changing the `RELATIVE_POS` constant in the environment file</sup></sup>

## State Representation Learning Models

Please look the [SRL Repo](https://github.com/araffin/srl-zoo) to learn how to train a state representation model.
Then you must edit `config/srl_models.yaml` and set the right path to use the learned state representations.

The available state representation models are:
- ground_truth: Hand engineered features (e.g., robot position + target position for mobile robot env)
- raw_pixels: Learning a policy in an end-to-end manner, directly from pixels to actions.
- autoencoder: an autoencoder from the raw pixels
- inverse: an inverse dynamics model
- forward: a forward dynamics model
- vae: a variational autoencoder from the raw pixels
- random: random features, the feature extractor, a convolutional network, is fixed after random initialization.
- srl_combination: a model combining several losses (e.g. vae + forward + inverse...) for SRL
- supervised: A model trained with Ground Truth states as targets in a supervised setting.
- robotic_priors: Robotic Priors model
- pca: pca applied to the raw pixels
- multi_view_srl: a SRL model using views from multiple cameras as input, with any of the above losses (e.g triplet and others)
- joints: the arm's joints angles (only for Kuka environments)
- joints_position: the arm's x,y,z position and joints angles (only for Kuka environments)

Please read the [documentation](https://s-rl-toolbox.readthedocs.io/) for more details (e.g. adding a custom SRL model).


## Troubleshooting
If a submodule is not downloaded:
```
git submodule update --init
```
If you have troubles installing mpi4py, make sure you the following installed:
```
sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin openmpi-doc
```

## Known issues

The inverse kinematics function has trouble finding a solution when the arm is fully straight and the arm must bend to reach the requested point.
